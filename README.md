## Assignment
Assignment 1: This assignment will produce some foundational classes to be used in an overall system. The classes will incorporate the outcomes associated with Module 01. Specifically, these classes will incorporate encapsulation through the use of private attributes and public accessors and mutators. Additionally, these classes will benefit from thorough unit testing, including unit test planning. Keep in mind that the classes developed in this assignment will contribute to upcoming assignments. Choosing appropriate identifiers and having comprehensive documentation will be of great importance as the overall project grows and changes throughout the semester.

## Encapsulation
In this assignment, I used self.__ to encapsulate two classes, ensuring that the data within each class cannot be accidentally referenced by other classes. I also wrote accessors for each class to access the data, ensuring that the data within the class cannot be arbitrarily modified.
