# Intermediate Software Development Automated Teller Project
This project will be developed over the course of several assignments.  Each assignment will build on the work done in the previous assignment(s).  Ultimately, an entire system will be created to manage bank transactions for clients who have one or more bank accounts.

## Assignment 1
Assignment 1: This assignment will produce some foundational classes to be used in an overall system. The classes will incorporate the outcomes associated with Module 01. Specifically, these classes will incorporate encapsulation through the use of private attributes and public accessors and mutators. Additionally, these classes will benefit from thorough unit testing, including unit test planning. Keep in mind that the classes developed in this assignment will contribute to upcoming assignments. Choosing appropriate identifiers and having comprehensive documentation will be of great importance as the overall project grows and changes throughout the semester.


## Encapsulation
In this assignment, I used self.__ to encapsulate two classes, ensuring that the data within each class cannot be accidentally referenced by other classes. I also wrote accessors for each class to access the data, ensuring that the data within the class cannot be arbitrarily modified.

## Assignment 2
Assignment 2: This assignment builds on the basic BankAccount class by adding Chequing, Investment, and Saving accounts. Each subclass implements its own service charge rules using inheritance and polymorphism. Encapsulation is kept with private attributes, and clear docstrings are added for readability and maintainability.

Since assignment 2 is saved in another repository, there is no step of creating a branch at the beginning of the job and merging the branches at the end.
